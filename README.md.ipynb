    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a path planner model to drive vehicle around a 3-lane track and change lane as it sees opportunity to go ahead of other vehicles in front. The lane change action has to be performed safely without bumping into other vehicle as well as causing crash. The vehicle acceleration and turning has to be performed with minimal jerk to ensure comfort level for the passengers. The model processes a series of sensor data (x,y,s,d,yaw,speed,previous-path_x,previous_path_y,end_path_s,end_path_d,sensor_fusion,etc) to track the reference path and to predict the vehicle drive path, including lane changing. Spline library is used to optimize the waypoint fitting of the predicted reference path. Similar to other pervious projects in Term2, the path planning model is connected to a simulator via uWebSocketIO with waypoints of the reference path.\n",

    "##### main.cpp\n",
    "establishes communication between simulator and path_planning model using uWebSocketIO, and reads in sensor data during a set time intervals. Data is passed into path planning class for initialization, processing sensor data, updating finite state machine (FSM) of path planner, and generating trajectory of the new predicted path. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### path_planner.h and path_planner.cpp\n",
    "contains 1 main class: pathPlanning. \n",
    "\n",
    "pathPlanning class receives sensor data periodically. Base on the new sensor data, pathPlanning loops through all other vehicles data, for their locations and speed, then calculates the latest closest distance between other vehicles with respect to the subjected car, the cost functions of each lane with respect to their closest vehicle in both front and back. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 major functions involved: initPathPlanning(), processSensorData(), isChangeLaneSafe(), updateFSM(), generateTrajectory().\n",
    "\n",
    "initPathPlanning() initializes all costs and predicted waypoints back to their default state or zero at every new data receives to start fresh. \n",
    "\n",
    "processSensorData() loops through all other vehicles data from sensor\\_fusion to find the closest vehicle to the subjected car in each lane, considering both front and back. This maps out the landscape of the surround and ignores those that are outside of laneVisibleDist\\_ to avoid unnecessary tracking. Base on their s distance to the subjected car, and the velocity difference, cost\\_[] of changing lane into each lane is established for FSM to make decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "isChangeLaneSafe() determines if it is safe to proceed from the existing lane to the targeting lane base on other vehicles position. The min\\_safe\\_dist\\_front\\_ and min\\_safe\\_dist\\_back\\_ ensure that there is enough room to the front and back vehicle on the left and the right before signaling safe to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "updateFSM() tracks its current state of the subjected car. With the lowest cost\\_[\\*] and isChangeLaneSafe(), it determine which direction the car should turn, (target\\_lane\\_), vs staying in the current lane. The FSM also controls the speed of the car to either catch up or slow down to match the speed of vehicle in front to avoid collision, or the max legal speed. maxTravelSpeed\\_. \n",

    "generateTrajectory() reuses up to 10 previous\\_path\\_x and previous\\_path\\_y waypoints to ensure smooth lane change transition. New way points are added from the 11th previous\\_path\\_\\* alone with new points from the spline fitting line to ensure a smooth fitting line for lane change.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Setup\n",
    "I create an AWS instance to execute pathPlanning executible and run term3_sim simulator in local PC. Data is sent through AWS server to local PC client, which create latency. The latency is obvious during implementation when switching between wired and WiFi connections. I end up tuning my model with wired connect to keep things consistent.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Cost function\n",
    "Determine the right cost function is important to for the FSM to make decision. I start dividing the distance between subjected car and the closest vechicle in front of each lane (closest\\_front\\_s\\_diff\\_[\\*]) by the delta of velocity between two cars (ref\\_v\\_ - closest\\_front\\_v\\_[\\*]) to determine the time the two vehicle apart. The larger the time is the bigger the buffer and the less cost it should be. With exponential function on the result of the division, it doesn't reveal such relationships. Reciprocal of exponential results seems to provides that relationship, but the spread is too heavy on one side rather than evenly distributed. After a few try, I settle with 100-exp(x) where x is (closest\\_front\\_s\\_diff\\_[\\*])/(ref\\_v\\_ - closest\\_front\\_v\\_[\\*]). It provides the gradual increase of weight as x decrease which fits the bill of what I am looking for. \n",

    "### Results\n",
    "Unlike all previous project, this project is quite challenging as it is not given a lot of hints or guidance to begin with. However, all materials are covered by lecture one way or the other. It is up to us the student to put them together. There are many ways to approach the problem set and I found this very interesting when working out all the piece to finalize my solutions with 3 state FSM or even possibly to improve to a 2 state FSM. The result is quite satisfactory as one of my best lap reaches 46 miles without instance. The challenging part is to tuning the safety distance, speeds, and even the newly generated waypoints to avoid jerk when changing lanes. Below, I capture a few of the screenshot to illustrate the lane change moments and the best lap result.\n",
